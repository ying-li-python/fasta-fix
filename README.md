# Fix spacing in FASTA 
For some strange reason, the conventional FASTA contains a sequence that breaks at every 70-100 letters and creates an indentation. This is a major problem if weÂ want to use computational tools to help us analyze genetic information.

To avoid spending too much time re-formatting every FASTA sequence from [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), I wrote a Python script to do so. For this example, I used the <i>[period](http://flybase.org/download/sequence/FBgn0003068/FBpp)</i> gene of <i>Drosophila melanogaster </i> from Flybase. It was my gene of interest during my PhD research.

## Getting started

You will need to download/clone this folder, and in command line, route to this folder using the cd command. 
```
git clone https://github.com/ying-li-python/fasta-fix.git
cd fasta-fix 
```
### Original FASTA file 

Example FASTA:

## Setting up
Add a FASTA file in the fasta-fix folder for you to fix. In this case, the file is [FlyBase_YGMHKX.fasta](https://github.com/ying-li-python/fasta-fix/blob/master/FlyBase_YGMHKX.fasta).

Using a text or code editor, open fasta_fix.py. I highly recommend [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Replace the FASTA file path to your own. 

```
fastafile = open("FlyBase_YGMHKX.fasta", 'r')
```

## Running the script 
Now that you finished setting up, you are ready to run the the script in command line. Make sure your directory is still in fasta-fix folder.

```
python fasta_fix.py 
```

Your script will generate a new FASTA file named output.fasta in the same folder. And you're done! 

Output:

## Methods
For this script, we created a for-loop, set conditions (```if else``` statements), and used ```.split()``` and ```.close()``` function.
